1.What is javascript?

->Interpreted language
    it goes top to bottom, left to write 
   
    it is a scripting language.
    another example of scripting language is python.

-> Object oriented language
   #modularity -> Breaking whole code into manageable pieces.
               -> which increases reusablity of code.

-> Dyanamic 
       in languages which are not dynamic we have to manually mention the data type
       but in languages like javascript we can dirrectly assign data

       var a = "arth"
       var a = 10

-> Javascript can easily be runned into browser.
    ->javascript is a client side programming language.
